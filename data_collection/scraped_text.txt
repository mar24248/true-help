        place where everyone is respected, protected, and connected.

Are engaged in business in California
Intend to sell or lease tangible personal property that would
                ordinarily be subject to sales tax if sold at retail (this
                includes wholesalers, manufactures and retailers.)
Will make sales for a temporary period, normally lasting no

How much does it cost to buy insurance through Covered California?
The best way to get a quick estimate of the price you would pay is
              to use the
Shop and Compare Tool
. The price is based on your estimated income for the coverage
              year, your ZIP code, your household size and your age. If you are
              a low- or moderate-income Californian, you may get help buying
              insurance from Covered California through monthly subsidies that
              lower your premium costs so that you pay less for top-quality,
              brand-name insurance. Learn more about
who qualifies for a subsidy
.
More information:
Apply for Medical Insurance
How much does Medi-Cal cost?
For many individuals who enroll in Medi-Cal, there is no premium,
              no co-payment, and no out of pocket cost. Some households will see
              affordable costs, such as a low monthly premium. For some Medi-Cal
              children, the monthly premiums are $13 per child up to a family
              maximum of $39 per month. In general, individuals in Medi-Cal will
              get the same health benefits available through Covered California
              at a lower cost.

Air quality
South Coast Air Quality Management District and the California Air
          Resources Board are working together to measure air quality in your
          area.
Eaton fire area
Mobile monitoring survey #1 was completed on January 31, 2025.
Overall, results show
no elevated
levels of:
Air toxic metals including lead and arsenic
Volatile Organic Compounds including benzene
Some elevated levels of methane, possibly from gas leaks, were
                detected. These results were reported to utilities and public
                health agencies for further investigation.
Mobile monitoring survey #2 was completed on February 19, 2025,
                and results will be posted when analysis is complete.
Reported by South Coast Air Quality Management District
Palisades fire area
Mobile monitoring survey #1 was completed on February 10, 2025.
Overall, results show
no elevated
levels of:
Air toxic metals including lead and arsenic
Volatile Organic Compounds including benzene
One elevated level of methane, possibly from a gas leak, was
                detected. This result was reported to utilities and public
                health agencies for further investigation.
Mobile monitoring survey #2 was completed on February 21, 2025,
                and results will be posted when analysis is complete.
Reported by South Coast Air Quality Management District
How we are monitoring
mobile monitoring surveys completed in Eaton and Palisades
                    areas
stationary air quality monitoring sites deployed for Eaton
                    and Palisades areas
additional stationary air quality monitoring sites planned
Reported by South Coast Air Quality Management District
Monitoring occurs in two stages: mobile monitoring surveys and
          stationary monitoring.
Stage 1: Mobile monitoring surveys:
These capture a
            snapshot in time of toxic metals and volatile organic compounds
            (VOCs). This will help identify locations for stationary air quality
            monitoring sites. There were 4 mobile monitoring surveys: 2 in the
            Eaton Fire area and 2 in the Palisades Fire area.
Stage 2: Stationary air quality monitors:
They
            measure pollutants in the air. This includes particulates (PM2.5 and
            PM10), lead, arsenic, other toxic metals, and asbestos.

Cleanup and debris removal
Help your business
Volunteer
Track LA's progress
Cleanup and debris removal after wildfires is a 2-phase process. You can
        have it done at no cost to you.
We will explain these phases. When they are complete, your property is
          ready for rebuilding.
Hazardous waste cleanup
In Phase 1, the U.S. EPA cleans up everyday products that were in your
          home and can be dangerous.
These include:
Batteries
Cleaners and solvents
Fertilizers and pesticides
Paints and oils
Propane tanks and other pressurized products
How to get cleanup
Phase 1 is automatic for all residential properties.
There's no cost to you for this cleanup.
You don't need to do anything for Phase 1 cleanup to begin.
Cleanup statuses explained
Properties are being assessed and cleaned up by the EPA now.
Once the EPA assesses your property, it will have a status.
They will post that status in a sign on your property.
You can also check this
EPA map
for the cleanup status of your property.
Phase 1 Complete
This status means the EPA has finished their cleanup work.
Your property
may not be
safe yet. There can
              still be:
Hazardous waste that's buried
Health hazards like ash and asbestos
OR
Deferred to Phase 2
This status means the EPA can't safely clean your property until
              debris has been removed.
It will be cleaned in Phase 2.
See
Phase 1 progress.
Debris removal
In Phase 2, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) removes
          structural debris.
This includes:
Damaged foundations
Destroyed vehicles
Trees that are a hazard
Contaminated soil
Asbestos
Ash
See the progress of this work in
USACEâs debris removal map
.
How to get debris removed
To get debris removed, you must choose to:
Opt in for free removal
OR
Opt out to arrange and pay for removal yourself
There are no out-of-pocket costs for this service. If you have
          insurance, your insurer will be billed.
Debris removal cannot start until Phase 1 cleanup is completed or
          deferred by the EPA.
Opt in by the deadline
To get free debris removal, you must
opt in by March 31, 2025
.
Opt in for free removal
To complete the opt-in form, you'll need:
Contact info and signatures of all owners of the property
Assessor's information number, or AIN
Find your AIN
Homeowners insurance information (if you're insured)
Vehicle information for any destroyed vehicles on the property
Opt out at your own expense
If you opt out of free debris removal, you'll arrange for and pay for
          this service yourself.
This process is complicated and expensive. You must:
Hire a licensed, specialized contractor
Get approval and a permit from LA County
Hire a certified consultant to check your property for asbestos
Make sure your contractor follows all government rules for safe
              debris removal
How to opt out
If you choose to opt out, submit an
opt-out form
to LA County right away.
It's important to submit this form so that the county can start free
          debris removal for your neighbors.
You will need:
Name and license number of your contractor
Description of the debris you need to remove
Assessor's information number, or AIN
Find your AIN
If you need help
Questions about Phase 1 cleanup
Call the EPA at
833-798-7372
(TTY:
            711)
Help filling out the opt-in form
Call the LA County Public Works Debris Removal Hotline at
844-347-3332
(TTY: 711)

State law protects residents. It prevents insurance companies from
              canceling or not renewing home insurance polices for one year in
              areas near a wildfire. This 1-year moratorium applies to all
              residents in the affected area, including total and no loss.

Use policy
The State of California wants you to know about the collection, use, security,
  and access to information that may be obtained through use of the Stateâs web
  portal. By visiting this website, you are accepting the policies and practices
  described in this Notice. This Notice covers the following topics:
Personal information and choice
A special note about children
Information collected and how it is used
What happens to Information you submit to us
Use of internet request for assistance form information
Surveys
If you send us e-mail
Public disclosure
Personal information

Limitation of liability
Ownership
This Use Policy is subject to change without notice, and that it reflects the
  Stateâs current business practices. This Use policy is dated December 7, 2000.
  Each department within the State may have additional privacy and use policies
  specific to the mission and needs of their work. Be sure to review those
  policies as you access additional sites within the State.
Personal information and choice
âPersonal informationâ is information about a natural person that identifies
  or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name,
  social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone
  number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history,
  readily identifiable to that specific individual. A domain name or Internet
  Protocol address is not considered personal information, however, it is
  considered âelectronically collected personal information.â
According to Government Code Â§ 11015.5., âelectronically collected personal
  informationâ means any information that is maintained by an agency that
  identifies or describes an individual user, including, but not limited to:
his or her name
social security number
physical description
home address
home telephone number
education
financial matters
medical or employment history
password
electronic mail address
information that reveals any network location or identity, but excludes any
    information manually submitted to a State agency by a user, whether
    electronically or in written forma
information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a
    business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers,
    or principals of that business.
âElectronically collected personal informationâ that we automatically collect
  includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical
  information about which web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in
  an activity that asks for specific information (i.e., completing a request for
  assistance, personalizing the content of the website, sending an e-mail, or
  participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose
  not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your
  ability to use any other feature of the website.
If any type of personal information is requested on the website or volunteered
  by the user, State law, including the Information Practices Act of 1977,
  Government Code Section 11015.5., and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may
  protect it. However, this information may be a public record once you provide
  it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise
  protected by federal or State law.
Additionally, departments and agencies of the State of California under the
  authority of the Governor are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy which
  is also accessible on this website.
A special note about children
Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal
  information, and we require that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit
  any personal information to us. This includes submitting personal information
  to the State as part of a user profile or personalization profile. If you are
  a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or
  guardians. If you are a minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.
If the State decides to begin collecting personal information from children,
  it will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for
  collecting it, and disclose our intended use of it. The State will seek
  parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information. If
  it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being
  collected, view their childâs information, and, if they choose, prohibit the
  State from making further use of their childâs information. The State will not
  provide personal information about children to third parties.
Information collected and how it is used
We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to
  use some of our services. Collection of this information is required to
  deliver the specific services, but use of these services is voluntary.
The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the
  content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our
  services. This information does not identify you personally and is used for
  gathering website statistics. The information we automatically collect and
  store in our logs about your visit helps us to analyze our website to
  continually improve the value of the materials available. Our website logs do
  not identify a visitor by personal information, and we make no attempt to link
  other websites with the individuals that browse the Stateâs website.
Government Code Â§ 11015.5.(a)(6) prohibits all state agencies from
  distributing or selling any electronically collected personal information, as
  defined above, about users to any third party without the permission of the
  user. The State does not sell any âelectronically collected personal
  information.â Any distribution of âelectronically collected personal
  informationâ will be solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us.
The State may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of
  regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is sold
  or distributed, and all relevant legal protections still apply to the Stateâs
  websites.
What happens to the information you submit to us?
If you choose to submit information to us, the information will be transmitted
  through secure lines to our departmental database. Any private information
  will only be used for the purposes for which it was provided and will not be
  shared with another entity except as prescribed by law. Review our
Privacy Policy
for additional
  information.
Use of internet request for assistance form information
Any information you provide to us will only be shared with entities involved
  in your case as necessary. Information you provide may be included with other
  consumersâ information to be used for statistical reporting, trending data,
  and/or investigative actions. For example, we may need to retain information
  that becomes part of an enforcement action or consumer complaint case for a
  period of time after the closing date of the case.
If you provide us with information regarding an issue that does not fall
  within our regulatory jurisdiction, we may refer your information to the
  appropriate local, State, or federal agency on your behalf.
Surveys
If during your visit to the Stateâs website you participate in a survey or
  send an e-mail, the following additional information will be collected:
The e-mail address and contents of the e-mail; and
Information volunteered in response to the survey.
The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include
  audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.
The information is retained in accordance with Government Code Â§ 11015.5.
If you send us e-mail
You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail with a
  comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or
  to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your e-mail to other State
  employees who may be better able to help you, and this staff may be employed
  by a different agency within the State. Except for authorized law enforcement
  investigations or, as required by law, we do not share our e-mail with any
  other organizations.
We use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to
  address issues you identify, to further improve our website, or to forward the
  e-mail to another agency for appropriate action.
Public disclosure
In the State of California, laws exist to ensure that government is open and
  that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information
  possessed by State government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the
  publicâs right to access public records. These exceptions serve various needs
  including maintaining the privacy of individuals. Both State and federal laws
  provide exceptions.
All information collected at this site becomes public record that may be
  subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law
  exists. In the event of a conflict between this Use Policy and the Public
  Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other law governing the
  disclosure of records, the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act,
  or other applicable law will control.
Personal information
Under Government Code Â§ 11015.5., if you choose, you may have any personal
  information collected about you discarded without reuse or distribution,
  provided we are contacted in a timely fashion.
Automatic collection of information/cookies
When you visit a State of California website, you should be aware that data
  linking your computer to a particular website (a âcookieâ) may be created.
  Temporary cookies may be used when necessary to complete a transaction, to
  process data submitted to us online, to facilitate an ongoing Internet
  interaction, or to understand trends in the use of State websites. Cookies do
  not compromise your privacy or security. Using web browser settings, you can
  refuse the cookies or delete the cookie file from your computer by using any
  of the widely available methods.
Security
The State, as developer and manager of this web site, has taken several steps
  to safeguard the integrity of its telecommunications and computing
  infrastructure, including but not limited to authentication, monitoring,
  auditing, and encryption. Security measures have been integrated into the
  design, implementation, and day-to-day practices of the entire State operating
  environment as part of its continuing commitment to risk management. This
  information should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or
  other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information
  provided via the Stateâs supported web site. The technical standards governing
  security are enforced by the Department of Finance.
Links to other sites
Our website has links to sites we feel might be useful to you and which may
  provide services. When you link to another site, you are no longer on our site
  and are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.
The State of California accepts no responsibility for the content or
  accessibility of the external websites or external documents linked to on this
  website.
This website and the information it contains are provided as a public service
  by the State of California. This system is monitored to ensure proper
  operation, to verify the functioning of applicable security features, and for
  comparable purposes. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such
  monitoring. Unauthorized attempts to modify any information stored on this
  system, to defeat or circumvent security features, or to utilize this system
  for other than its intended purposes are prohibited and may result in criminal
  prosecution.
Limitation of liability
The State attempts to maintain the highest accuracy of content on its web
  site. Any errors or omissions should be reported for investigation.
The State makes no claims, promises, or guarantees about the absolute
  accuracy, completeness, or adequacy of the contents of this website and
  expressly disclaims liability for errors and omissions in the contents of this

Privacy policy
Privacy policy
Effective 5/23/17
The California Department of Technology, which runs CA.gov, is committed to
  promoting and protecting the privacy rights of individuals, as enumerated in
  Article 1 of the California Constitution, the Information Practices Act of
  1977, and other state and federal laws.
It is the policy of the Department of Technology to limit the collection and
  safeguard the privacy of personal information collected or maintained by the
  Department. The Department of Technologyâs information management practices
  conform to the requirements of the Information Practices Act (Civil Code
  Section 1798 et seq.), the Public Records Act (Government Code Section 6250 et
  seq.), Government Code Sections 11015.5 and 11019.9, and other applicable laws
  pertaining to information privacy. This Privacy Policy only applies to the
  CA.gov website run by the Department of Technology.
âPersonal informationâ
is information about a natural person that identifies or describes an
  individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security
  number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education,
  financial matters, and medical or employment history, readily identifiable to
  that specific individual. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not
  considered personal information; however, it is considered âelectronically
  collected personal information.â
According to Government Code Â§ 11015.5,
âelectronically collected personal informationâ
means any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or
  describes an individual user, including, but not limited to, his or her name,
  social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone
  number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password,
  electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or
  identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to a State agency by
  a user, whether electronically or in written form, and information on or
  relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business capacity,
  including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of
  that business.
âElectronically collected personal informationâ that we automatically collect
  includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical
  information about which web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in
  an activity that asks for specific information (i.e., completing a request for
  assistance, personalizing the content of the website, sending an e-mail, or
  participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose
  not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your
  ability to use any other feature of the website.
If any type of personal information is requested on the website or volunteered
  by the users, it is governed by state law, including California Civil Code
  section 1798 et seq., Government Code 11015.5, the California Public Records
  Act, and the Federal Privacy Act. This information may become a public record
  once it is provided and except for electronically collected information, it
  may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by
  federal or state law.
The Department of Technology adheres to the following principles in connection
  with the collection and management of personal information:
The Department of Technology collects personal information on individuals
      only as allowed by law.
The Department limits the collection of personal information to what is
    relevant and necessary to accomplish its lawful purpose. For example, the
    Department may need to know an individualâs e-mail address or telephone
    number in order to answer the individualâs questions or in order to provide
    requested assistance.
The Department of Technology does not collect home, business or e-mail
      addresses, or account information from persons who simply browse the
      CA.gov website.
Personal information about individuals is collected through this website
    only if an individual provides such information to the Department
    voluntarily through e-mail, registration forms, or surveys, for example.
    This information will be used to facilitate in responding to the person or
    improve the content or navigation of the website or provide survey
    information to users. The information collected in this manner is not
    subject to requests made pursuant to the Public Records Act, and site
    visitors may request to have their information discarded without reuse or
    distribution.
The Department of Technology uses Google Analytics to help improve the
      website.
Google tracking cookies may be used to provide information to Google
    Analytics. Our website may use Google Analytics to track website statistics.
    Google tracking code used by every website or application that employs
    Google Analytics, stores information that identifies device IP addresses,
    but our website is anonymizing that information and only part of device IP
    addresses are being used. Consequently, no information identifying you or
    your device is being stored at Google via our utilization of Google
    Analytics implementation.
You can find out more about Google Analytics anonymized IP addresses by
      clicking here.
The Department of Technologyâs use of your e-mail.
You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail with a
    comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or
    to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your e-mail to other State
    employees who may be better able to help you, and this staff may be employed
    by a different agency within the State. Except for authorized law
    enforcement investigations or, as required by law, we do not share our
    e-mail with any other organizations. We use your e-mail to respond
    appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you
    identify, to further improve our website, or to forward the e-mail to
    another agency for appropriate action. Submission of an email to the
    Department, the Department staff and/or communication through the website
    does not create any attorney-client or other privileged or confidential
    relationship. Accordingly, do not disclose any information to the Department
    that you wish to remain private or confidential.
The Department of Technology provides people who provide personal
      information with an opportunity to review that information.
Individuals, who provide personal information, are allowed to review the
    information and contest its accuracy or completeness.
The Department of Technology uses personal information only as specified
      and consistent with those purposes; unless the Department obtains the
      consent of the subject of the information, or as required or allowed by
      law.
The Public Records Act exists to ensure that California government is open
    and that the public has a right to have access to appropriate records and
    information possessed by many state and local government agencies. At the
    same time, there are exceptions that recognize the publicâs right to access
    records. These exceptions serve various needs, including maintaining the
    privacy of individuals. In the event of a conflict between this Policy and
    the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act or other law governing
    the disclosure of records, the applicable law will control.
How the Department of Technology collects and uses your information.
We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer
    to use some of our services. Collection of this information is required to
    deliver the specific services, but use of these services is voluntary.
How the Department of Technology protects your information.
The Department, as developer and manager of this website, has taken several
    steps to safeguard the integrity of its telecommunications and computing
    infrastructure, including but not limited to authentication, monitoring,
    auditing. Security measures have been integrated into the design,
    implementation, and day-to-day practices of the entire State operating
    environment as part of its continuing commitment to risk management. This
    information should not be construed in any way as giving business, legal, or
    other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information
    provided via the Departmentâs supported website. The technical standards
    governing security are enforced by the Department of Finance.
If you do nothing during your visit to the website but browse or download
  information, we automatically collect and store the following information
  about your visit:
A partial Internet Protocol address and domain name is collected, but not
    the e-mail address. The partial Internet Protocol address is used to direct
    Internet traffic to you without identifying you individually and generate
    statistics used in the management of this website;
The type of browser and operating system you used;
The city and zip code you used it from;
The date and time you visited this website;
The web pages or services you accessed at this website;
The website you visited prior to coming to this website;
The website you visit as you leave this website, and;
If you downloaded a form, the form that was downloaded.
The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the
  content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our
  services. This information does not identify you personally and is used for
  gathering website statistics. The information we automatically collect and
  store in our logs about your visit helps us to analyze our website to
  continually improve the value of the materials available. Our website logs do
  not identify a visitor by personal information, and we make no attempt to link
  other websites with the individuals that browse our website. Individuals have
  the right to have any electronically collected personal information deleted by
  the Department, without reuse or distribution. Individuals may request to have
  their electronically collected personal information deleted via the contact
  form reachable from the âContact Usâ link at the top and bottom of each page.
Electronically collected personal information is exempt from requests made
  under the Public Records Act.
Government Code Â§ 11015.5 prohibits all state agencies from distributing or
  selling any electronically collected personal information, as defined above,
  about users to any third party without the permission of the user. The
  Department does not sell any âelectronically collected personal information.â
  Any distribution of âelectronically collected personal informationâ will be
  solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us.
The Department may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports
  of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is
  sold or distributed, and all relevant legal protections still apply to the
  website.
The Department will provide additional explanations of this privacy policy, if
  requested. If any individuals have any further questions about this privacy
  policy, they are encouraged to contact the Department via email, by phone at
  (916) 319-9223, or by mail to:
California Department of Technology
1325 J Street, Suite 1600
Sacramento, CA 95814

If you are employed in California, your employer must provide a safe workplace and pay all the wages you are owed. If you think an injury or illness is work-related, you may be able to receive workersâ compensation benefits from your employer to pay for medical care and partial wages. Your labor rights allow you to ask your employer about your pay and working conditions. When you exercise your labor rights, it is against the law for your employer to retaliate against you.

                  (BREA)
The mission of BREA is to safeguard public trust by promoting professionalism in the real estate appraisal industry through licensing, education, and enforcement. In 1989, Title XI of the federal Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act was adopted by congress mandating states to license and certify real estate appraisers who appraise property for federally related transactions. The federal law was enacted as a result of the savings and loan disaster.

In response to the federal mandate, the Real Estate Appraisers Licensing and Certification Law was enacted by the California Legislature in 1990 (AB 527, Chapter 491 of 1990). BREA was established within the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, and charged with developing and implementing a real estate appraiser licensing and certification program compliant with the federal mandate.

When is the best time for me to file a claim?
The effective date of your UI claim is based on the date you file your claim online or the date you first contact the Employment Development Department (EDD). The effective date determines your base period, and as a result, your benefit amount. A base period is a 12-month period of earnings, divided into quarters. The base period is used to establish a claim and calculate an award. You may wish to review your wages during each quarter of the base period to determine the best time to file. You will not receive any benefits until you actually submit an application or
call EDD
to file a claim.
To establish a valid claim, you must have earned at least (1) $1300 in one quarter of your base period, or (2) at least $900 in your highest quarter and total base period earnings of 1.25 times your high quarter earnings.

What is the Standard Base Period?
A Standard Base Period includes wages from a 12-month period of time consisting of the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters.
If your claim begins in:
January-February-March: Your Standard Base Period is the prior 12 months, ending the last day of September.
April-May-June</strong>: Your Standard Base Period is the prior 12 months, ending the last day of December.
July-August-September: Your Standard Base Period is the prior 12 months, ending the last day of March.

Description
The Civil Rights Department is the state agency charged with enforcing Californiaâs civil rights laws. The mission of the CRD is to protect the people of California from unlawful discrimination in employment, housing, businesses, and state-funded programs, and from bias-motivated violence and human trafficking.  The CRD is the largest state civil rights agency in the country. It was established by the Legislature in 1959 as the Division of Fair Employment Practices and was initially part of the Department of Industrial Relations. In 1980, it became an independent department, known as the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), and was charged with enforcing California's comprehensive employment, housing, public accommodations, and public service non-discrimination laws, as well as the state's bias-related hate violence law. In 2022, the department's name was changed to the Civil Rights Department to better reflect our mission of enforcing a broad range of civil rights laws.

Frequently Asked Questions
What are the eligibility requirements?
To be eligible for the California’s Low Cost Auto Insurance Program, or CLCA, consumers must:
Have a valid California driver’s license
Own a vehicle valued at $25,000 or less
Meet income eligibility guidelines
Be at least 16 years of age
Have a Good Driving Record
Iâm a provider and Iâm having a problem with insurers reimbursing, denying or
contesting the claim I submitted in a timely manner. Can they do that?
No. Health insurers have a legal obligation to promptly pay claims. Insurance Code §§ 10123.13
and 10123.147 require insurers to pay claims as soon as possible but no later than 30 working
days after receipt of a complete claim, unless the insurer notifies the provider in writing that the
claim has been denied or is being contested. Insurers must pay interest on a completed claim if
the claim has not been reimbursed, contested or denied within the 30 working-day deadline.11
Failure to comply with the claims handling deadlines in state law may also be considered an
unfair claims settlement practice under Insurance Code § 790.03(h). Providers should contact
the Department’s Provider Complaint Center if a health insurer is not paying claims in
compliance with these deadlines.

Resources for impacted Californians
Californians deserve a government that works for them and with them. One
        that will work to ensure opportunity and justice. We are building a
        California not for the few, but for all â including those who have
        historically been left out.
We are doing the work to make our state a place for every Californian
        and all the diversity that makes us strong. Our state will be known as a
        place where everyone is respected, protected, and connected.

California gas facts
California is acting to protect our people from gas price
                      spikes. Weâre working toward a future of cleaner air and
                      better roads for all.Â
Fact: Price spikes at the pump are profit spikes for the oil
                  industry.
California refineries go offline for maintenance with no plan
                  for backfilling supply. This increases prices and oil industry
                  profits. A new state law by Governor Gavin Newsom is working
                  to fix this.
Fact: Rapid changes in gas prices are due to oil industry
                profits and costs.Â
Californiaâs state taxes and fees donât change day-to-day. Oil
                industry profits and costs do. The oil industry drives
                fluctuations in gas prices, including price spikes. Californians
                paid a record $2.61 more per gallon than the national average in
                2022. Yet state taxes and fees stayed the same.
Explore what drives gas price spikes
Fact: Every gallon of gas you buy helps build better roads and
                  funds climate action.
Cleaner fuels and charging polluters are essential parts of
                  Californiaâs climate plan. Proceeds from the stateâs
                  cap-and-trade program have raised $28 billion. We put this
                  money into projects that fight climate change and cut air
                  pollution.
Our climate policies will save Californians an estimated $200
                  billion in health costs by 2045.
Californiaâs gas taxes also benefit residents by funding
                  needed infrastructure.
Spotlight: Californiaâs Low Carbon Fuel Standard
Have you heard of our stateâs Low Carbon Fuel Standard? Itâs a
                  unique tool that cuts pollution and saves drivers at the pump.
                  Here are some frequently asked questions.
What is the Low Carbon Fuel Standard?Â
The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) was established by
                        Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2007 to diversify and
                        expand Californiaâs transportation fuel supply,
                        decarbonize our transportation sector and improve air
                        quality.
How does LCFS work?
It sets a declining carbon-intensity target for
                        Californiaâs transportation fuels. Fuel producers can
                        choose to comply by:
Meeting that target,
Exceeding the target and earning âcreditsâ by
                          producing low carbon fuels, and in doing so, they can
                          bank credits for the future or sell to other producers
                          who have not met the target, or
Buying credits from other producers to make up for any
                          shortfalls in meeting their target.
This market-based approach lets producers find the most
                        efficient way for their businesses to meet requirements,
                        while creating a financial incentive for producers to
                        develop cleaner fuels.
How much money does LCFS generate?
Every year, the LCFS generates $4 billion in private
                        sector investment toward a cleaner transportation sector
                        that reduces pollution and benefits Californians. Going
                        forward, the LCFS will spur even more private sector
                        investment in clean fuels.
What happens with the money that LCFS generates?
The program adds no revenue to state coffers; rather, it
                        gets invested back into California communities.
Farms are investing in methane capture
technology to produce renewable electricity, biomethane,
                        and hydrogen.
UPS is investing in renewable natural gas
vehicles that reduce emissions.
EV companies like Rivian
have put their headquarters in California because of
                        programs like the LCFS. The
nationâs leading airlines
recently partnered with the state to use sustainable
                        aviation fuels.
And alternative fuels are getting cheaper, thanks to
                        LCFS. Renewable diesel, which was once more expensive
                        than traditional fossil diesel, is now getting more
                        competitive in price with its petroleum counterpartâ.
                        Today, zero-emission vehicles are more affordable and
                        increasingly common on Californiaâs roads. This shift is
                        a direct result of the LCFS creating a market where
                        cleaner fuels can thrive, driving down costs and
                        providing more options for consumers.
Does the LCFS save Californians money?
Yes. This private sector investment ultimately keeps
                        money in Californiansâ pockets through:
Increasing consumer choices, which drives
                          transportation fuel price competition
Growing new industries and attracting investments that
                          support jobs and strengthen communities
Reducing dependence on petroleum, the oil industry,
                          thereby protecting consumers from its associated
                          supply and cost volatility
Making electric vehicles more affordable
Expanding access to electric vehicle charging and
                          hydrogen refueling infrastructure
Reducing health care costs associated with air
                          pollution from fossil fuels
Itâs made California a world leader in clean fuels and
                        innovation, becoming a dominant economic sector for the
                        state.
Will the updated LCFS program continue saving consumers
                      money?
Yes. The updated program will increase economic benefits
                        to Californians. For example:
Californians should expect to see an estimated
42% reduction in total fuel costs
per mile by 2045 â translating to
savings of over $20 billion in fuel expenditures
                            every year
.
For passenger cars, these fuel cost savings will be
                          even more pronounced, cutting todayâs costs to
                          Californians by more than 50%.
The amount of LCFS proceeds invested in disadvantaged
                          communities for clean fuel and transportation projects
                          is estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion over the
                          next decade.
Californians are expected to save almost $5 billion in
                          health care costs by avoiding the impacts of air
                          pollution.
How does LCFS impact the price of gasoline?
The LCFS regulations do not automatically raise prices
                        at the pump.
When companies shift the cost of complying with the LCFS
                        regulation to consumers, the self-reported data from
                        fuel producers show Californians pay between $0.08 to
                        $0.10 per gallon of gasoline for these clean fuel
                        standards.
Oil companies do not have to shift these costs to
                        consumers â there are other options for complying. This
                        includes absorbing them as part of a firm's standard
                        operational costs, purchasing credits from cleaner fuel
                        producing firms or producing cleaner fuels themselves,
                        which would allow them to generate credits for sale to
                        other fuel producing firms. And in fact, some oil
                        companies have already begun producing low carbon fuels
                        themselves, in direct response to the LCFS.
Does LCFS raise gas prices?
No, the updated program does not automatically raise gas
                        prices. In fact, itâs expected to help save Californians
$20 billion every year
collectively in lower fuel costs.
The vast majority of what people pay at the pump right
                        now, especially during those price spikes we saw in 2022
                        and 2023, go towards Big Oil and their profits.
Does LCFS contribute to gasoline price spikes?
No. In fact, more production of cleaner fuels means less
                        dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil, which helps
                        shield Californians from spikes in gas prices. And LCFS
                        has displaced more than 30 billion gallons of petroleum
                        fuel since 2011.
State agencies examined data on retail gasoline prices
                        between 2019 and 2023. The LCFS and other environmental
                        programs contributed to roughly 6% of the increase in
                        retail gasoline prices during this time period. Federal,
                        state and local taxes and fees accounted for 12%.
80% of the increase in retail gasoline prices during
                        this time period went to oil companies.
State fees, taxes and environmental programs paid by
                        gasoline consumers are re-invested in California and
                        deliver benefits such as improved air quality, safer
                        roads and improvements to public transit. This cannot be
                        said for the other costs embedded in retail gasoline
                        prices that consumers pay per gallon of gasoline.
Why are we hearing so much about the LCFS and gas prices?
Big polluters and their allies have spent millions of
                        dollars to push a false narrative about Californiaâs gas
                        prices. Why? Simply put, theyâre placing profits ahead
                        of the needs of California consumers â allowing gas
                        prices to spike by keeping supplies artificially low and
                        reaping billions of dollars in doing so.
What happens if gas prices do go up?
Affordability remains a key consideration for the state.
                        The Air Resources Board directed staff to assess any
                        impacts of the recently updated policy on retail
                        gasoline prices every year, beginning one year from the
                        effective date of the changes to the LCFS.
Fact: California is working to combat gas price spikes.
With new tools, the state is closely tracking gas prices. We
                look at several factors, including gas supply and refinery
                maintenance.
We also have a new watchdog agency, the
Division of Petroleum Market Oversight
. It focuses on market oversight and identifying market
                manipulation by refiners.
California has also proposed a first-in-the-nation rule for
                refineries. It would require them to maintain a minimum
                inventory of fuel. They would have to responsibly plan for
                interruptions due to maintenance. This would prevent price
                spikes from artificially low supply when demand is high.
                Californians could save hundreds of millions, if not billions,
                of dollars.Â Â
